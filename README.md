Mission 4 - Code Structuring								
Recommended Duration								
0.5 to 1.0 day(s)								
								
Background								
By completing Mission 3, you should have a simple working Spring Boot application that persists data in MySQL, but the code might not be well-structured as we did not enforce it previously.								
This mission is for you to understand and set up your code structure (if you have not). And also to get a basic understanding about dependency injection, which is one of the key features of Spring Framework.								
								
Prerequisites								
1. Completed Mission 3								
2. Basic understanding of MVC design pattern								
3. Basic understanding Spring Bean and Dependency Injection								
4. (Extra) Basic understanding of Validation / Exception Handling								
								
What you need to do								
1. Implementation done with usage of @RestController, @Service and @Repository annotations.								
2. Implementation done with usage of @Autowired annotation.								
3. Organise your classes into different packaging / directory. For instance, POJO / model classes into com.example.HelloWorld.model								
4. Check in your source code in your GitHub repo.								
5. Verify your code structure with facilitators via MS Teams								
								
Extra								
You could also implement exception handling using @ExceptionHandler and @ControllerAdvice annotations.
